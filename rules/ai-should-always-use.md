Always apply your suggested fixes, do not ask for confirmation unless you are really unsure

The name of an integration test must always end with "Integration". Ex: TestPaygateCardPaymentCallbackHTTPGateway_NonexistentPaymentID_Integration

To run commands, check the Makefile at the root of the repo first.
To regenerate all autogenerated artefacts (mockgen, sqlc etc.) use "make generate". To run tests, use make test.

To return date and time via gRPC or rest API, always return unix timestamps in milliseconds with type = int64
